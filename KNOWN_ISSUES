As of the 1.0.2 release, we have the following known issues. They are all
considered of low importance, and while we intend to fix them we currently make
no promises about when.

* When testing a zone using GOST-family algorithms in DNSSEC and having an
  underlying OpenSSL library without GOST support, the Zonemaster DNSSEC test
  results may be misleading or unpredictable. The Net::LDNS module will warn at
  build time if OpenSSL lacks GOST support.
  
* Zonemaster is not threadsafe. This is mainly a problem in Net::LDNS, and will
  hopefully be fixed relatively soon.
